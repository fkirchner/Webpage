      Hey there. I am a Ph.D student drawn to theoretical and
      applied research in computer science. I am working in the fields of
      <i>theorem and algorithm proving</i>, and <i>software security</i>. More
      specifically I am interested in the communication between proof systems,
      the design of proof languages and in deduction modulo.

      <i>A Finite First-Order Theory of Classes.</i>
      <a href="data/fotc2006.pdf">[ee]</a> <a href="data/fotc2006.bib">[bib]</a> <br />
      Post-proceedings of the 2006 International Workshop on Proofs and Programs, 2007.
      </p>
      <p class="abstract">
      We expose a formalism that allows the expression of any theory with one or
      more axiom schemes using a finite number of axioms. This allows us to give
      finite first-order axiomatizations of arithmetic and real analysis, and a
      presentation of arithmetic in deduction modulo that has a finite number of
      rewrite rules.  Overall, this formalization relies on a weak calculus of
      explicit substitutions to provide a simple and finite framework.

      <i>Rule-Based Operational Semantics for an Imperative Language.</i>
      <a href="data/rule2006.pdf">[ee]</a> <a href="data/rule2006.bib">[bib]</a> <br />
      (with Fran&ccedil;ois-R&eacute;gis Sinot) 7th International Workshop on Rule-Based Programming, 2006.
      </p>
      <p class="abstract">
      Operational semantics for programming languages usually come in two
      flavours: big-step and small-step. Both are defined using
      <i>deduction</i> rules with a congruence rule allowing reduction in
      certain contexts. For a description based on <i>rewrite</i> rules,
      known approaches consist in deriving an abstract machine, which is
      very close to implementation. In this paper, we describe the
      operational semantics of an imperative language in a rule-based style,
      arguably as abstract as the other kinds of semantics. Moreover, we
      combine the approach with the store-based semantics, which puts the
      focus on memory states rather than values, which is more appropriate
      for imperative languages.

      <i>PVS#: Streamlined Tacticals for PVS.</i>
      <a href="data/strategies2006.pdf">[ee]</a> <a href="data/strategies2006.bib">[bib]</a>.

      (with C&eacute;sar Mu&ntilde;oz) 6th International Workshop on Strategies in Automated Deduction, 2006.
      </p>
      <p class="abstract">
      The semantics of a proof language relies on the representation of the <i>state</i> of
      a proof after a logical rule has been applied. This information, which is
      usually meaningless from a logical point of view, is fundamental to describe
      the control mechanism of the proof search provided by the language. In this
      paper, we propose a datatype, called <i>proof monad</i>, to represent the state
      information of a proof and we illustrate its use in PVS. Furthermore, we show
      how this representation can be used to design a new set of powerful PVS
      tacticals that have simple and clear semantics. The implementation of these
      tacticals is called PVS#.

      Fellowship is a prototype proof assistant using sequent calculus logics
      and proof terms. It is designed to generate proof scripts for other
      formal tools, such as <acronym 
      title="The Coq proof assistant, based on the calculus of inductive constructions.">
      Coq</acronym> and <acronym 
      title="The prototype verification software.">PVS</acronym>. More

      options, are found on its <a

      A library of real closed fields has been developped for Fellowship, using
      results in the theory of classes to encode second-order formulas in the
      prover's first-order framework. The documented specifications and proofs
      can be downloaded <a
      href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Florent.Kirchner/fellowship/index.html">

      aims at defining a simple strategy language for the prover. Its
