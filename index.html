      Hey there. I am a post-doctoral fellow drawn to theoretical and applied
      research in computer science. I am working in the fields of <em>formal
      methods</em> and <em>software security</em>. More specifically I am
      interested in deduction modulo, in proof systems interactions, in
      language design, and in formal system analysis.

      A formalism for expressing the operational semantics of proof languages
      used in procedural theorem provers is proposed. It is argued that this
      formalism provides an elegant way to describe the computational features
      of proof languages, such as side effects, exception handling, and
      backtracking. The formalism, called proof monads, finds its roots in
      category theory, and in particular satisfies the monad laws. It is shown
      that the framework’s monadic operators are related to fundamental tactics
      and strategies in procedural theorem provers. Finally, the paper
      illustrates how proof monads can be used to implement semantically clean
      control structure mechanisms in actual proof languages.</li>

      Numerous computational and deductive frameworks use the notion of
      strategy to guide reduction and search space exploration, making the
      macro scale control of micro operations an explicit object of interest.
      In recent works, abstract strategies have been defined  in extension but
      also intensionally. In this paper we complete these views with a new
      declarative approach based on constraints, which are used to model the
      different parts of a strategy. This procedure allows us to express
      elaborate strategies in a declarative and reusable way. </li>

      If the discoveries of forensic analysts are to hold up to scrutiny in
      court, they must meet the standard for scientific evidence.  Software
      systems are currently developed without consideration of this fact. We
      argue for the development of a formal framework for constructing <em>digital
      artifacts</em> that can serve as proxies for physical evidence, that is they
      are difficult to forge.  A system so imbued will facilitate sound digital
      forensic inference. As a case study, we describe filesystem augmentation
      needed to transparently provide such support.</li>

      With applications that range from quantitative program analysis to safety
      of <abbr title="Air traffic control">ATC</abbr> algorithms, decision
      methods for the existential theory of reals make a growingly important
      class of tools for interactive and automatic theorem provers. The <abbr
      title="Extended claude database">ECDB</abbr> is a centralized data store
      that is designed to allow the sharing and incremental certification, by
      external provers, of complex proofs in real algebra generated by <a
      href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0793114/rahd/">RAHD</a>. It is
      currently work in progress, and can be previewed by checking out the
      <span class="mono">rahd+ecdb</span> branch of the RAHD <a

      The Evidential Tool Bus takes a novel approach towards formal
      verification tools composition and interoperability, by relying on
      asynchronous message passing with a unified proof data structure.
      Prototyping work was carried out during my postdoctoral visit at SRI
      International, there are no immediate plans to make it public.

      <abbr title="Fellowship"><em>fsp</em></abbr> is a proof
      assistant using sequent calculus logics and proof terms. It is designed
      to generate proof scripts for other formal tools, such as <abbr
      title="The Coq proof assistant"> Coq</abbr> and <abbr title="SRI's
      Prototype Verification Software">PVS</abbr>. More information, and
      download options, are found on its <a
      href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Florent.Kirchner/fellowship/trunk/index.html">website</a>.
      A library of real closed fields has been developped for <em>fsp</em>,
      using results built from von Neumann, Gödel and Bernays' theory of
      classes to encode second-order formulas in the prover's first-order
      framework.  Documented specifications and proofs are also available <a
      href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Florent.Kirchner/fellowship/trunk/index.html">online</a>.

      is a PVS package that aims at defining a simple strategy language for the
      prover. Its implementation is based on a categorical construction,
      encoded as a datatype and associated functions, called a proof monad.
