      I am a post-doctoral fellow currently in the Celtique INRIA
      project-team. I am working in the fields of formal methods and software
      security; more specifically I am interested in aerospace endeavors, in
      composite proof techniques, in language design, and in formal system
      analysis.

        <li class="abstract">
        Exchanging mutable data objects with untrusted code is a delicate
        matter because of the risk of creating a data space that is accessible
        by an attacker.  Consequently, secure programming guidelines for Java
        stress the importance of using defensive copying before accepting or
        handing out references to an inter- nal mutable object. However,
        implementation of a copy method (like clone()) is entirely left to the
        programmer. It may not provide a sufficiently deep copy of an object
        and is subject to overriding by a malicious sub-class. Currently no
        language-based mechanism supports secure object cloning. This paper
        proposes a type-based annotation system for defining modular copy
        policies for class-based object-oriented programs. A copy policy
        specifies the maximally allowed sharing between an object and its
        clone. We present a static enforcement mechanism that will guarantee
        that all classes fulfill their copy policy, even in the presence of
        overriding of copy methods, and establish the semantic correctness of
        the over- all approach in Coq. The mechanism has been implemented and
        experimentally evaluated on clone methods from several Java libraries.

        <li class="abstract">
        RAHD is a tool that takes advantage of a heterogeneous collection of
        proof procedures to decide the satisfiability of formulas in the
        existential fragment of the theory of real closed fields. But system
        analysts can rarely restrict themselves only to arithmetic-based
        problems: they might want to use RAHD as part of a more diverse formal
        toolbox.  In this paper, we present ongoing work on an architecture that
        enables the skeptical integration of RAHD into general-purpose proof
        assistants.  We will present a system-level view of how this integration
        can be performed, and examine efficiency concerns for this
        implementation.</li>

        A formalism for expressing the operational semantics of proof languages
        used in procedural theorem provers is proposed. It is argued that this
        formalism provides an elegant way to describe the computational features
        of proof languages, such as side effects, exception handling, and
        backtracking. The formalism, called proof monads, finds its roots in
        category theory, and in particular satisfies the monad laws. It is shown
        that the framework’s monadic operators are related to fundamental tactics
        and strategies in procedural theorem provers. Finally, the paper
        illustrates how proof monads can be used to implement semantically clean
        control structure mechanisms in actual proof languages.</li>

      With applications that range from quantitative program analysis to safety
      of <abbr title="Air traffic control">ATC</abbr> algorithms, decision
      methods for the existential theory of reals make a growingly important
      class of tools for interactive and automatic theorem provers. The <abbr

      that is designed to allow the sharing and incremental certification, by
      external provers, of complex proofs in real algebra generated by <a
        href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0793114/rahd/">RAHD</a>. It is

      The Evidential Tool Bus takes a novel approach towards formal
      verification tools composition and interoperability, by relying on
      asynchronous message passing with a unified proof data structure.
      Prototyping work was carried out during my postdoctoral visit at SRI
      International, there are no immediate plans to make it public.

      <abbr title="Fellowship"><em>fsp</em></abbr> is a proof
      assistant using sequent calculus logics and proof terms. It is designed

      A library of real closed fields has been developped for <em>fsp</em>,
      using results derived from von Neumann, Gödel and Bernays' theory of
      classes to encode second-order formulas in the prover's first-order
      framework.  Documented specifications and proofs are also available <a
