      Hey there. I am a post-doctoral fellow drawn to theoretical and
      applied research in computer science. I am working in the fields of
      <i>formal methods</i> and <i>software security</i>. More
      specifically I am interested in the communication between proof systems,
      the design of proof languages and in deduction modulo.

      <blockquote><p>
      In this paper we are contributing to the theoretical foundations of
      strategies and to the convergence of different points of view, namely
      rewriting-based computations on one hand, rule-based deduction and
      proof-search on the other hand. We will rely on previous works and
      strategy languages that have been recently designed and studied.  In
      rewriting, from elementary strategies expressions directly issued from a
      term rewriting system R, more elaborated strategies expressions can be
      built using a strategy language. A similar mechanism also exists in proof
      systems, where a set of core strategies is used to program sophisticated
      proof search patterns.

      <blockquote><p>
      Developments of formal specifications and proofs have spectacularly
      blossomed over the last decades, hosted by a diversity of frameworks,
      systems and communities. And yet, the heterogeneity of these environments
      has hindered some fundamental steps in the scientific process: the
      sharing and reuse of results. This dissertation proposes a way of
      distributing the same formal development between various proof systems,
      thus augmenting their interoperability.

      <blockquote><p>
      The semantics of a proof language relies on the representation of the
      state of a proof after a logical rule has been applied. This information,
      which is usually meaningless from a logical point of view, is fundamental
      to describe  the control mechanism of the proof search provided by the
      language.  In this paper, we present a monadic datatype to represent the
      state information of a proof and we illustrate its use in the PVS theorem
      prover.  We show how this representation can be used to design a new set
      of powerful tacticals for PVS, called PVS#, that have a simpler and
      clearer semantics compared to the semantics of standard PVS tacticals.

      Fellowship is a prototype proof assistant using sequent calculus logics
      and proof terms. It is designed to generate proof scripts for other
      formal tools, such as <acronym 
      title="The Coq proof assistant, based on the calculus of inductive constructions.">
      Coq</acronym> and <acronym 
      title="SRI's Prototype Verification Software.">PVS</acronym>. More
      information, and download
      options, are found on its <a

      A library of real closed fields has been developped for Fellowship, using
      results in the theory of classes to encode second-order formulas in the
      prover's first-order framework. The documented specifications and proofs
      can be downloaded <a
      href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Florent.Kirchner/fellowship/index.html">

      is a PVS package that aims at defining a simple strategy language for the
      prover. Its implementation is based on a categorical construction,
      encoded as a datatype and associated functions, called proof monad.
