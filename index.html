      Hey there. I am a post-doctoral fellow drawn to theoretical and applied
      research in computer science. I am working in the fields of <i>formal
      methods</i> and <i>software security</i>. More specifically I am
      interested in the rich interaction between proof systems, the design of
      proof languages and in deduction modulo.

      If the discoveries of forensic analysts are to hold up to scrutiny in
      court, they must meet the standard for scientific evidence.  Software
      systems are currently developed without consideration of this fact. We
      argue for the development of a formal framework for constructing <i>digital
      artifacts</i> that can serve as proxies for physical evidence, that is they
      are difficult to forge.  A system so imbued will facilitate sound digital
      forensic inference. As a case study, we describe filesystem augmentation
      needed to transparently provide such support.</li>

      In this paper we are contributing to the theoretical foundations of
      strategies and to the convergence of different points of view, namely
      rewriting-based computations on one hand, rule-based deduction and
      proof-search on the other hand. We will rely on previous works and
      strategy languages that have been recently designed and studied.  In
      rewriting, from elementary strategies expressions directly issued from a
      term rewriting system R, more elaborated strategies expressions can be
      built using a strategy language. A similar mechanism also exists in proof
      systems, where a set of core strategies is used to program sophisticated
      proof search patterns.</li>

      <li class="abstract">
      Developments of formal specifications and proofs have spectacularly
      blossomed over the last decades, hosted by a diversity of frameworks,
      systems and communities. And yet, the heterogeneity of these environments
      has hindered some fundamental steps in the scientific process: the
      sharing and reuse of results. This dissertation proposes a way of
      distributing the same formal development between various proof systems,
      thus augmenting their interoperability.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      More recent, yet-unpublished work include a journal article on the
      structure of dynamic proof interaction and a conference note on the
      design of a distributed proof system.

      <p>
      The Evidential Tool Bus takes a novel approach towards formal
      verification tools composition and interoperability, by relying on
      asynchronous message passing with a unified proof data store. This work
      was carried out during my postdoctoral visit at SRI International, and
      hasn't been made public yet.

      <i>fsp</i> is a prototype proof assistant using sequent calculus logics
      and proof terms. It is designed to generate proof scripts for other
      formal tools, such as <abbr 
      title="The Coq proof assistant, based on the calculus of inductive constructions.">
      Coq</abbr> and <abbr 
      title="SRI's Prototype Verification Software.">PVS</abbr>. More
      information, and download
      options, are found on its <a

      <p>
      A library of real closed fields has been developped for fsp, using
      results in the theory of classes to encode second-order formulas in the
      prover's first-order framework. The documented specifications and proofs
      can be downloaded <a
      href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Florent.Kirchner/fellowship/index.html">here</a>.

      is a PVS package that aims at defining a simple strategy language for the
      prover. Its implementation is based on a categorical construction,
      encoded as a datatype and associated functions, called a proof monad.
