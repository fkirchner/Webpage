      <li class="abstract">
      Exchanging mutable data objects with untrusted code is a delicate
      matter because of the risk of creating a data space that is accessible
      by an attacker.  Consequently, secure programming guidelines for Java
      stress the importance of using defensive copying before accepting or
      handing out references to an internal mutable object. However,
      implementation of a copy method (like clone()) is entirely left to the
      programmer. It may not provide a sufficiently deep copy of an object
      and is subject to overriding by a malicious sub-class. Currently no
      language-based mechanism supports secure object cloning. This paper
      proposes a type-based annotation system for defining modular copy
      policies for class-based object-oriented programs. A copy policy
      specifies the maximally allowed sharing between an object and its
      clone. We present a static enforcement mechanism that will guarantee
      that all classes fulfill their copy policy, even in the presence of
      overriding of copy methods, and establish the semantic correctness of
      the overall approach in Coq. The mechanism has been implemented and
      experimentally evaluated on clone methods from several Java libraries.

      RAHD is a tool that takes advantage of a heterogeneous collection of
      proof procedures to decide the satisfiability of formulas in the
      existential fragment of the theory of real closed fields. But system
      analysts can rarely restrict themselves only to arithmetic-based
      problems: they might want to use RAHD as part of a more diverse formal
      toolbox.  In this paper, we present ongoing work on an architecture that
      enables the skeptical integration of RAHD into general-purpose proof
      assistants.  We will present a system-level view of how this integration
      can be performed, and examine efficiency concerns for this
      implementation.</li>

      A formalism for expressing the operational semantics of proof languages
      used in procedural theorem provers is proposed. It is argued that this
      formalism provides an elegant way to describe the computational features
      of proof languages, such as side effects, exception handling, and
      backtracking. The formalism, called proof monads, finds its roots in
      category theory, and in particular satisfies the monad laws. It is shown
      that the framework’s monadic operators are related to fundamental tactics
      and strategies in procedural theorem provers. Finally, the paper
      illustrates how proof monads can be used to implement semantically clean
      control structure mechanisms in actual proof languages.</li>

    <h1>Software + Proofs</h1>

    <p>
    With applications that range from quantitative program analysis to safety
    of <abbr>ATC</abbr> algorithms, decision methods for the existential
    theory of reals make a growingly important class of tools for interactive
    and automatic theorem provers. The <abbr title="Extended case database">ECDB</abbr> 
    is a centralized data store that is designed to allow the sharing and
    incremental certification, by external provers, of complex proofs in real
    algebra generated by <a
      href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0793114/rahd/">RAHD</a>. It is
    currently work in progress, and can be previewed by cloning the <span
      class="mono">rahd+ecdb</span> branch of the RAHD <a
      href="http://code.google.com/p/rahd/">repository</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Evidential Tool Bus takes a novel approach towards formal
    verification tools composition and interoperability, by relying on
    asynchronous message passing with a unified proof data structure.
    Prototyping work was carried out during my postdoctoral visit at
    <abbr>SRI</abbr> International, there are no immediate plans to make it
    public.
    </p>

    <p>
    <abbr title="Fellowship"><em>fsp</em></abbr> is a proof assistant using
    sequent calculus logics and proof terms. It is designed to generate proof
    scripts for other formal tools, such as Coq and <abbr>PVS</abbr>. More
    information, and download options, are found on its <a
      href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Florent.Kirchner/fellowship/trunk/index.html">website</a>.
    A library of real closed fields has been developped for <abbr
      title="Fellowship"><em>fsp</em></abbr>,
    using results derived from von Neumann, Gödel and Bernays' theory of
    classes to encode second-order formulas in the prover's first-order
    framework.  Documented specifications and proofs are also available <a
      href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Florent.Kirchner/fellowship/trunk/index.html">online</a>.

    <p>
    <a href="http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/people/cam/Practicals/">Practicals</a>
    is a PVS package that aims at defining a simple strategy language for the
    prover. Its implementation is based on a categorical construction,
    encoded as a datatype and associated functions, called a proof monad.
